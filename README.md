## Positive News â€“ Restoring Faith in Humanity

Especially now with the pandemic, newspapers and newsfeeds are constantly being filled with depressing news, negatively affecting our mental health. Our project aims to solve this issue by having a website where only good news are presented! 

The project was developed using Python and SQL on the back-end to scrape various news networks, while flask and Vue.js was used to connect to the frontend and display features on our website. On the website, each positive news article is displayed, where users can see a brief description of each article, and can click on the link to read more! While this is not meant to be a source of daily news, we feel it is important to provide a platform that showcases the triumphs and advances happening right now, restoring faith in humanity.
